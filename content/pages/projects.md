## Doing Bayesian Data Analysis
I have created [Python code (PyMC3)](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python) for a selection of models and figures from the book *'Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan'*, Second Edition, by John Kruschke (2015).

## Introduction to Statistical Learning
I have created of a [repository](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) containing Python code for a selection of tables, figures and LAB sections from the book *'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'* by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).

The repository has been [referenced by KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/04/top-10-ipython-nb-tutorials.html), a leading site for Analytics, Big Data, Data Science, and Data Mining.
