    "Many people have a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server in their home networks to share files and perhaps function as a private cloud. These NAS servers usually offer different ways (protocols) to share files with devices on the network. Most common protocols are:\n",
    "* [Server Message Block (SMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)\n",
    "  \n",
    "* [Network File System (NFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMB protocol is the standard in Windows networks, whereas NFS is used more in Unix/Linux environments. I have a [Synology](https://www.synology.com/) NAS and have both Linux and Microsoft Windows clients connecting to the fileserver. \n",
    "\n",
    "SMB works fine on Linux too, but there are a number of advantages in using NFS which I will not detail here. However, certain steps in NFS configuration are especially important to make file permissions work properly/securely with version 4 of the NFS protocol. This has to do with how user accounts on the NAS are mapped and authorized to the user accounts on the Linux client. A quick and dirty setup on the Synology NAS is possible: mapping all connecting NFS clients to a guest account on the NAS. As a consequence, owners of the files created on the NFS share are mapped to user `nobody`. With this setup I ran into issues with using `git` on the NFS fileshares since my Linux user was not the owner of the repository files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I describe how I configured NFSv4 + Kerberos on the Synology NAS and my Linux client in order to work properly with regards to file ownership and permissions. This is by no means an exhaustive description and assumes some prior knowledge on the subjects, but hopefully it gives some form of guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "System environment:\n",
    "- **NFS Server**: Synology DS216+ NAS running DSM 7.1.1-42962 Update 6  \n",
    "  - NFSv4\n",
    "  - Kerberos 5 v1.18.3\n",

    "    * Mounting NFSv4 share on NAS.\n",
    "    * Acting as Kerberos KDC (Kerberos Distribution Center). Note: in larger networks the KDC would typically be on a separate server. \n",

    "#### Kerberos\n",
    "NSFv4 clients are authenticated on user level. This can be done using standard UNIX authentication (AUTH_SYS), but then user accounts on client and NAS need to match on UID/GID level as I understand it. The other authentication method uses [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)) Understanding how Kerberos works (high level) takes some time. It is typically one of those things where you will need to read documentation, try things out, re-read documentation and try some more.\n",

    "  The [Synology documentation](https://kb.synology.com/en-br/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_winmacnfs_nfs?version=7) mentions that _idmapd_ needs to be enabled. However, I noticed that the idmapd manual in Linux says that only NFSv4 servers need to have that daemon running. The client on newer Linux kernels now uses the _nfsidmap_ program to do name mapping. No need to enable idmapd.\n",
