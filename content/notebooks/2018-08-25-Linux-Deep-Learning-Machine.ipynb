    "Some time ago I decided to move from a MacOS development environment back to Linux for exploring and working with Python datascience and statistical modelling libraries. Though most of the Python libraries and platforms offer support for MacOS, things are generally easier in  Linux. One avoids a lot of special installation and compatability instructions. My first experience with Linux dates from 1996 when I bought a set of Slackware cdroms. Since then I have used Linux on various types of hardware, but not that much during the last few years. I mainly use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which are accessed through a webbrowser. So I will just run the Linux machine as a server and work in the notebooks through from my MacOS desktop using a browser. I find the Jupyter notebook a helpful tool, but [here](https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/1033035196428378113) are some valid points on its downsides.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second reason for wanting to switch back to Linux has to do with the fact that I want to take a look at running deep learning models on a Graphics Processing Unit ([GPU](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/)). My MacOS desktop (iMac) does not have compatible hardware or the possibility of installing such hardware. Today, the [GPU's and toolkits from Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/computeworks) are most common and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano support mainly those. I must admit that the GPU was not a strict requirement for the new hardware: I am currently interested in probabilistic programming in PyMC3 and those type of models generally do not benefit from running on a GPU. Using the CPU for the computations is often faster! But since i wanted to take a look at Keras/Tensorflow I opted for a GPU anyway, making it the most expensive hardware component in my build...\n",

    "My objective was *not* to build a high-end Deep Learning machine with multiple GPU's of the newest hardware available. I wanted to have a reasonably compact and average machine in terms of performance and cost. Checking component compatibility and reviews with help of [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) was very convenient. The actual installation of the hardware was not very difficult. Carefully read the manual of the motherboard and case. Those will pretty much show you in which order to put things together.\n",

Initially I went for the B250M-K which has one slot for GPU instead of two and two slots for RAM instead of four. This would have been fine since I do not intend on running multiple GPU's or upgrade to more RAM. But as it turned out, the B250M-K is not compatible with the case I had bought: it has only one connector for a case fan whereas my case came with two fans. I really liked the case so I decided to change the motherboard since the extra cost was small.\n",

It assumes that you have multiple GPU's and this will result in a RuntimeError. Specify `cores=1` when calling the `pm.sample()` method. If you have configured Theano to use the CPU instead of the GPU  (`device = cpu` in your `.theanorc` file), you can enter the number of cores of your cpu.
